            <img src="https://www.yummytummyaarthi.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/chicken-biryani-ingredients.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Making a perfect chicken biryani is easy and has few basic ingredients. In this blog post, I have shared three different method for making chicken biryani. Whatever method you choose, the ingredients will be similar. I have added optional ingredients which will add more flavour to the biryani. Here are the list of ingredients which you need for making restaurant style chicken biryani.</p>
            <h4>Basmati Rice:</h4>
            <p>the most essential and important ingredient in making biryani is rice. Try to find the finest quality basmati rice that you can afford. Better the quality of rice, better the aroma will be. Instead of basmati you can use seera samba rice. check notes for details.</p>
            <h4>Chicken:</h4>
            <p>for making biryani, use chicken with bone-in and skins-removed. Try and use medium size chicken for this recipe which cooks faster and stays juicy.</p>
            <h4>Onion:</h4>
            <p>onions are used in making masala and fried till crispy to add finishing touch to the biryani. These fried onions are called as birista which adds sweetness to the biryani</p>
            <h4>Ginger & Garlic:</h4>
            <p>this duo of ingredients gives the biryani aroma. Fresh ginger and garlic is ground and used. </p>
            <h4>Whole Spices:</h4>
            <p> cinnamon, cloves, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, bay leaf, cardamom is used. Whole spices are tempered in ghee and also these spices are dry roasted and ground to form fresh biryani masala which elevates your regular biryani to next level.</p>
            <h4>Fresh Herbs:</h4>
            <p>lots of chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves adds the aroma.</p>
            <h4>Spice powders:</h4>
            <p>a combination of chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder is used in biryani.</p>
            <h4>Optional Ingredients:</h4>
            <p> optional ingredients like coconut milk, fried cashews, raisins, fresh ground masala (shared in stove top method) can be used.</p>
